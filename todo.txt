config:
    - make two versions, one for current transformations, ones for all datarelated stuff
    - allow for different transformations for different objects 
    - dataloader (x)

annotator: 
    - transformations get bbox to be transformed aswell
    - adapt the annotator to work with many different objects and types

filter:
    - register them the same way the transformations are done rn (might need better datastructure)

random:
    - find a way all classes can use the same random instance (with seeds, thread safe)
    - allow transformation instances to generate new random value for each transformations

scene:
    - come up with a way to plug in different blending algorithms
    - manage the different objects better
